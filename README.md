PC04 Reader
==========

PC04 Reaer is a utility program to read paper tapes on a DEC PC04 Paper tape reader.

The hardware consists of an Arduino Uno card, but I guess that any Arduino board would work fine.

There is a also software for the host to read in the information read by the arduino board.
